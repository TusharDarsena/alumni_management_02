The Main Problem: Your Data Isn't Structured Correctly ðŸš¨
Your search queries are looking for structured data (e.g., an education array with objects containing a field property), but your import script is not creating that structure.

In your POST /import route, you have defined several very useful helper functions like parseEducation, parseExperience, and categorizeSkills, but they are never actually called when you normalize the data.

The normalize function currently does this:

JavaScript

// Problematic line
education: Array.isArray(entry.education) ? entry.education : undefined,
This code only works if the incoming JSON data already has a perfectly formatted education array. If entry.education is a string (e.g., "IIIT-Naya Raipur, BTech, 2017-2021"), it will be saved as undefined, and your filters for education.field will never find anything.

The Solution: Use Your Helper Functions During Import
You need to modify the normalize function to use the parsing helpers you've already written. This will ensure the data saved to MongoDB has the correct structure that your query code expects.

1. Update the normalize function:

Modify the doc object inside the normalize function to call your parsers. You'll need to know the field names from your source JSON files (I've used placeholders like entry.education_string below).

JavaScript

// Inside the /import route, update the normalize function

function normalize(entry) {
  // ... (keep the other fields as they are)

  // Use your parsing functions here!
  const educationData = Array.isArray(entry.education)
    ? entry.education
    : parseEducation(entry.education_string); // <-- Use the correct field name from your JSON

  const experienceData = Array.isArray(entry.experience)
    ? entry.experience
    : parseExperience(entry.position, entry.current_company_name, entry.location, entry.experience_string); // <-- Use correct field names

  const doc = {
    id: entry.id || linkedin_id || undefined,
    name: entry.name || "Unknown",
    // ... other fields
    experience: experienceData, // <-- Use the parsed data
    education: educationData,   // <-- Use the parsed data
    // ... rest of the fields
  };

  // ... (keep the rest of the function)
  return doc;
}
2. Delete Old Data and Re-Import:

After you fix the import script, the old data in your database will still be in the wrong format. You must:

Connect to your MongoDB database.

Delete all documents in the alumniprofiles collection.

Run your /import endpoint again to repopulate the database with correctly structured data.

Once you re-import with the corrected normalize function, your backend queries will be able to find the fields they need, and your search and filters should start working as expected.
