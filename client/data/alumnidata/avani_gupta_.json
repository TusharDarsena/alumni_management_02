  "about": "Passionate Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) student at IIIT Naya Raipur with a strong interdisciplinary focus bridging hardware systems, VLSI design, and AI-driven software solutions. My experience spans spintronics-based hardware security (PUFs), antenna optimization, and CAD/EDA simulations, alongside deep learning applications in medical imaging and LLM-powered hardware verification automation. With a GATE (ECE) qualification (AIR-1218) and hands-on projects in ResNet(2+1)D-based brain tumor classification, Verilog-to-testbench automation using Transformers, and CST-driven RF optimization, I bring expertise in both circuit-level innovation and AI-driven computational modeling. Skilled in Verilog, Python, C++, TensorFlow, and Cadence Virtuoso, I am passionate about building solutions at the intersection of electronics, computer science, and machine intelligence to advance healthcare, hardware security, and next-gen communication systems.",

      "description": "Efficient talent acquisition is critical for firms to succeed in today's changing employment market. The difficulty of finding the proper talent to hire grows along with the volume of applicants. Curriculum-Vitae (CV) or Resume screening is a cumbersome process in which an organization or firm examines a job applicant’s CV for recruitment. Numerous applicants with diverse skills and limited and conventional ways of candidate hiring make the resume screening process more labor-intensive and tedious. Thus, automating the hiring process is the need of the hour to strengthen efficiency and accuracy while segregating the most appropriate resume. To streamline the recruitment procedure, machine learning techniques can be applied to create a model that aids the recruiters in sorting out the most qualified candidates by extracting the most valuable insights from the heap of resumes accumulated."
