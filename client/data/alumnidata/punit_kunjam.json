Central to this work was the Sankofa Interface, which aligned tactile feedback with emotional and narrative arcs to create reflective and empathetic user experiences. This research contributed design principles for integrating haptics into educational and narrative-driven VR, highlighting their potential to enhance connection, learning, and engagement."

      "description": "Surgical simulators not only allow planning and training of complex procedures, but also offer the ability to generate structured data for algorithm development, which may be applied in image-guided computer assisted interventions. While there have been efforts on either developing training platforms for surgeons or data generation engines, these two features, to our knowledge, have not been offered together. We present our developments of a cost-effective and synergistic framework, named Asynchronous Multibody Framework Plus (AMBF+), which generates data for downstream algorithm development simultaneously with users practicing their surgical skills. AMBF+ offers stereoscopic display on a virtual reality (VR) device and haptic feedback for immersive surgical simulation. It can also generate diverse data such as object poses and segmentation maps. AMBF+ is designed with a flexible plugin setup that allows for unobtrusive extension for simulation of different surgical procedures. We show one use case of AMBF+ as a virtual drilling simulator for lateral skull-base surgery, where users can actively modify the patient anatomy using a virtual surgical drill. We further demonstrate how the data generated can be used for validating and training downstream computer vision algorithms."

      "date": "August 5, 2021",
      "description": "We present Pockets, a simple means of organizing and carrying 3D tools and other objects in virtual environments. Previous examples exist of using 3D tools with visually obvious affordances in virtual immersive environments instead of more traditional menus, however, in these applications a 2D menu is still necessary to select 3D tools from. Pockets make use of a belt with physical buttons, that objects can be assigned to. The Pockets design not only enables users to use their muscle memory to store and retrieve objects, thereby making tool use more efficient, but also solves the occlusion problem associated with state-of-the-art approaches such as 2D menus tied to the body or to the world space."

      "start_date": "Jun 2020",
      "description": "I worked on a system comparing different hazard indication and avoidance methods for users immersed in a virtual environment. Specifically, I developed a novel system for collision avoidance with people who may or may not be engaged in VR. I implemented this system using a machine learning-based human pose estimation framework, which tracks users in the simulated environment and offers visual and auditory feedback following different hazard indication and avoidance techniques. I used the redirected walking technique, which manipulates the scene around the users, causing them to reorient themselves in the virtual world, thus avoiding the collision. Video shows an experiment where a VR user tends to collect a specific item in the scene meanwhile the non-VR user (animated model) deliberately gets in the way of the VR user. The scene compensates itself by rotating the world so that the VR user will reposition itself accordingly in the 3D space, driving both VR and non-VR users away from each other."
