    "Gaurav Modi “I had the pleasure of working with Himanshu on our AI chatbot project, Genie, and was consistently impressed by his skills and mindset. He has a strong knack for problem-solving and approaches challenges with clarity and creativity. One of his standout strengths is how quickly he picks up new concepts - whether technical frameworks or domain-specific nuances, and applies them effectively. What makes Himanshu even more valuable is his ability to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders. He explains complex ideas in simple, actionable terms, ensuring everyone is aligned and confident in the direction forward. This not only accelerated our progress but also fostered smoother collaboration across the team. Himanshu would be an asset to any team, and I look forward to seeing the impact he continues to create in the AI space and beyond.”",
    "Sahej Sahni “Himanshu’s work at Clootrack was nothing short of exceptional. He’s a very reliable and dependable engineer who owns problems and doesn’t shy from going very deep. His understanding of the users sets him apart and he would bring immense value to every team he joins. I would recommend Himanshu for any team looking for a seriously skilled problem solver. ”"
