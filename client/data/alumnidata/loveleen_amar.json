      "description": "The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a bio-signal just like MRI, CT, fMRI. It is the recording of the electrical activity of the brain from the scalp. Our brain generates different EEG time-series patterns for different activities like moving hands, legs, eyes opening and closing, etc. So we can use deep learning techniques to recognize those patterns then we can classify them easily. Since this EEG signal is full of noise the major work involved here is to extract important features from the EEG data and then classify them. Since EEG is a time-series data so in this project the focus would be to use the Sequential network approach."
