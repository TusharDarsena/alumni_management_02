  "about": "Passionate Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) student at IIIT Naya Raipur with a strong interdisciplinary focus bridging hardware systems, VLSI design, and AI-driven software solutions. My experience spans spintronics-based hardware security (PUFs), antenna optimization, and CAD/EDA simulations, alongside deep learning applications in medical imaging and LLM-powered hardware verification automation. With a GATE (ECE) qualification (AIR-1218) and hands-on projects in ResNet(2+1)D-based brain tumor classification, Verilog-to-testbench automation using Transformers, and CST-driven RF optimization, I bring expertise in both circuit-level innovation and AI-driven computational modeling. Skilled in Verilog, Python, C++, TensorFlow, and Cadence Virtuoso, I am passionate about building solutions at the intersection of electronics, computer science, and machine intelligence to advance healthcare, hardware security, and next-gen communication systems.",
