  "about": "I learn by building. From an earthquake detector built solo to contributing to full-stack web apps — I’ve always believed in doing over talking. Right now, I’m diving deep into full-stack web development, AI, and machine learning — exploring how systems can think, adapt, and solve real problems. I’m a 2nd-year DSAI student at IIIT Naya Raipur, driven by curiosity and the urge to create. If you're building, exploring, or thinking beyond the obvious — we’ll get along.",
