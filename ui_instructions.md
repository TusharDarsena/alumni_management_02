Improve the UI by applying a bold, modern color palette with gradients. Add smooth hover animations and pressed states to buttons. Use a card layout with drop shadows for content sections. Apply a large, stylish font for headers with gradient text fill. Add subtle background animations like floating particles and a soft glow effect on interactive elements. Ensure the layout is responsive and accessible. Include micro-interactions for form inputs and navigation menu toggles.

Provide instructions for interactive UI elements like carousels, modals, and accordions with smooth transitions.
